## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A), evoking trust and stability. The choice of blue aligns with conventional finance branding and also avoids cliche.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E2E8F0) in light mode and night blue (#0F172A) in dark mode for a clean, modern look that is easy on the eyes. Background should be slightly desaturated in comparison to the primary.
- Accent color: Cobalt blue (#3B82F6) used for interactive elements and highlights. This analogous color contrasts in brightness to draw the eye, without clashing.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern user interface.
- Simple and clear icons from Heroicons to represent transaction types and categories.
- Clean and minimal layout with clear visual hierarchy for easy navigation and data presentation.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations (e.g., fade-in effects, loading spinners) to enhance user experience.
